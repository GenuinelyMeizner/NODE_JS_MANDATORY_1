                    Node Package Manager is the inbuilt package manager that sorts out all of your dependencies.

                    <br>
                    Your project dependencies are all the community/commercially made libraries/frameworks that you want to add to your project.

                    How do you use npm?

                <p class="text-light">
                    My opinion of a standard Node.js project would need the following dependencies.
                    <ul class="text-light">
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express" class="link-light">Express</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" class="link-light">Nodemon</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap" class="link-light">Bootstrap</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="link-light">
                    There are two ways (maybe more) to install npm's, both ways require us to open a terminal.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-light">
                    Predetermined package.json
                </h3>
                <p class="text-light">
                    We can predetermine which npm's we want to install and then install them all in one go.
                    To do this we need to create a file called package.json, it should be placed on the top-level of your projects directory.
                    In the package.json file you can manually write all the different libraries that you want to depend on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Disregard everything in the picture except the package.json file placement and content.
                </p>
                <img src="/ressources/images/package.PNG" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="text-light">
                    When you've written all the different dependencies you want, you need to run a command through the terminal.
                </p>
                <img src="/ressources/images/package_npm_command.PNG" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="text-light">
                    Using the command 'npm install' will install all the dependencies that you've written in the package.json file.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-light">
                    Manual npm install
                </h3>
                <p class="text-light">
                    If you want to install each library one by one, you still need a package.json file and a terminal open, but you do not need to fill out the dependencies, as the installation will do that for you automatically.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Instead of writing all the dependencies you just install the specific npm through a command.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This command, pictured below, will install bootstrap and automatically write it into your package.json file.
